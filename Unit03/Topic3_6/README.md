# 3.6 Equivielnt Boolean Expressions

De Morgans law (same logic/law from DE: not, and, or, nor, nand)
! || &&
!(a||b)=(!a&&!b)

to find the opposite of an expression distribute a not and switch or to and OR and to or

&& gets evaulated first not ||

truth tables are basically doing boolean algebra to reduce it
