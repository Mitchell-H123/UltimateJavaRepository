# Unit 6 - Array

## 6.1 - Array Creation and Access

an element is a single val of an array

length is a public final data member of an array

int [] listOne = new int[5];
listOne[2]=33;
-declaring an array is very different from c++ but assigning values are the same

can declare an array mutable
Mutable [] listTwo;
listTwo = new Mutable(33);
-this initializes all elements to null

can use an initializer in creating an array
double [] grades = {70.4, 432.5, 13.7532};

## 6.2 - Traversing Arrays

traversing an array means to access each element of an array

## 6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays

## 6.4 - Developing Algorithms Using Arrays
