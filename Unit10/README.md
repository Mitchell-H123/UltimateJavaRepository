# Unit 10 - Recursion

## 10.1 - Recursion

recrusive method is a method that calls itself

(wont have to write a recursive code on ap exam but might have to complete one)

after the method is done it returns to the previous method calls

## 10.2 - Recursive Searching and Sorting

dont use loops when using recursive calls

binary search: starts at middle
linear search: starts at beginning 
-these can be done with loops also and dont have to be done recursivley 
-used to sort elements in array lists

merge sort: left side of arraylist, then right, then merge them together
-sorts elements
-divides and conquers
