# 2.2 Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation)

constructer always starts with public
then it needs a name
then a paramerter list

ex:
public Person(String nm, int ag, boolean ad){
    name=nm;
    age=ag;
    isAdult=ad;
}

we can create a new object by using the class name
EX: Person mitchell

(similar to c++ classes, but different)

a default constructer can set everything to null

creating:
ex: Employee person1= new Employee("simon","6542",600000)

you need to use the keyword new to create an object
use null when you want to set something to a class but put nothing in it
