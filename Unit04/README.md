# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops

while( expression ){

}
-same as c++

prevent infinit loop

## 4.2 - `for` Loops

for(initialization; boolean expression; update){

}
-same as c++

for loop is better for a defined num of times
while is better for repeating based on an unknown amount of times
while loop is better for a more complex increment or decrement

common error for for loops= off by one error (OBOE)
make sure it is doing what it is ment to do
