# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops

while( expression ){

}
-same as c++

prevent infinit loop

## 4.2 - `for` Loops

for(initialization; boolean expression; update){

}
-same as c++

for loop is better for a defined num of times
while is better for repeating based on an unknown amount of times
while loop is better for a more complex increment or decrement

common error for for loops= off by one error (OBOE)
make sure it is doing what it is ment to do

## 4.3 - Developing Algorithms Using Strings

when using for loops with strings make sure it doesn't go past the length of the index
or tries to go negative index

must test many examples to make sure loop works correctly with wished output

## 4.4 - Nested Iteration

already knew this
inner loops go then outer go

## 4.5 - Informal Code Analysis

this is just figuring out how many times a loop will run
