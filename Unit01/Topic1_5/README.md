# 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables

casting ex: System.out.print((double)6/4);

double number;
int roundedNum = (int)(number+0.5)

casting has the type in () next to the number u want changed
(double)nums

with rounding you will take the number add .5 then cast it 
if the number is negative subtract .5 then cast

Double = up to 14-15 digits
Integer.MAX_VALUE; and Integer.MIN_VALUE; are the max and min int values allowed

you will get an error if a number is too big to store (overflow)
