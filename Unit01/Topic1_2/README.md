# 1.2 Variables and Data Types

boolean
int
double
string

varibles cant start with a digit
cant use characters such as $ @ &

java varibles declaring are the same as c++

final = something that wont change
ex. final double PI;
for final variables use ALL CAPS and underscores to name them
the same as const in c++
