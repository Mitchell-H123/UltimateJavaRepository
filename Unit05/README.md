# Unit 05 - Writing Classes

## 5.1 - Anatomy of a Class

use the class ---> instances of the class-objects
attributes of the objects ---> instance varibles
behaviors of the objects ---> methods

public methods
-no restriction on access
-other classes can access
private methods
-restriction on access
-only access in given class

encapsulation

## 5.2 - Constructors

constructors are always public
name matches the class

default and overloaded constructors

default has empty ()
overloaded has parameters in ()

## 5.3 - Documentation with Comments

//
/*    */

java doc comment(similar to multi line but starts with /**)
/**
*comment
*comment
*/

preconditions=conditions must be true for the method to work

## 5.4 - Accessor Methods

accessor methods allow safe access to instance vars

referred as get methods or getters

returns a copy of private vars

must be public and no parameters

toString method
-returns a string with info about the instance vars
-public String toString()
-always returns a string
-no parameters

## 5.5 - Mutator Methods

allow the change of values for instance vars outside of the class
often referred as set methods or setters
if there is any need for a different class to modify the instance vars, mutator methods are necessary

must be public
retrun type must be void
parameter must match the type of instance var

## 5.6 - Writing Methods

## 5.7 - Static Variables and Methods

## 5.8 - Scope and Access

## 5.9 - `this` Keyword

## 5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems
